# Phase 2 Project - Pitbull Party

Welcome to Pitbull Party - a website designed for Pitbull lovers, enthusiasts, and advocates alike. Details on requirements, navigation, and code can be found below.

## Introduction/Purpose

The goal of the webpage is for Pitbull enthusiasts to learn more about the lovable pups I have come to know over the years as well as create custom Pitbull cards with their own information. The webpage is broken up into various *pages* that can be navigated through the *Menu*.

## Opening the Webpage

In order to open the webpage, you will need to fork the following two respositories:

[Phase 2 Project Front End](https://github.com/Jazper55555/phase-2-project)

[Phase 2 Project Back End](https://github.com/Jazper55555/json-server-template)

The first repository allows you to actually run the webpage using:
`npm start`

The second repsoitory allows to access the data needed to populate the proper renders on each *page*. You can access the data using:
`json-server --watch db.json`

## Navigating the Webpage

There are 4 main *pages* that may be navigated once the website is up and running:

1. **Home**
2. **About**
3. **Pits**
4. **Pit Generator**

Each of these 4 *pages* can be found on either the **Home** page menu or the toggle menu found in the upper left hand corner of the screen.

Here's the basic breakdown of each *page*:

#### Home
This is the Home *page* where you will immediately be shown the menu front and center. The navigation menu can also be found in the upper left hand corner of the screen.

#### About
This is where you will find some useful information on the webpage itself as well as some advocating words for the Pitbulls.

#### Pits
Here, you can see the Pitbulls that make up the Pitbull Party crew as well as some fun facts about each pup.

#### Pit Generator
This is a random image generator that will display a customized Pitbull Card similar to the ones in the Pits *page* based on the information you input. Each time you fill in the blanks, a new card is generated based on your input.
