# Phase 2 Project - Pitbull Party

Welcome to Pitbull Party - a website designed for Pitbull lovers, enthusiasts, and advocates alike. Details on requirements, navigation, and code can be found below.

## Introduction/Purpose

The goal of the webpage is for Pitbull enthusiasts to learn more about the lovable pups I have come to know over the years as well as create custom Pitbull cards with their own information. The webpage is broken up into various *pages* that can be navigated through the *Menu*.

## Opening the Webpage

In order to open the webpage, you will need to fork the following two respositories:

[Phase 2 Project Front End](https://github.com/Jazper55555/phase-2-project)
[Phase 2 Project Back End](https://github.com/Jazper55555/json-server-template)

The first repository allows you to actually run the webpage using:
`npm start`

The second repsoitory allows to access the data needed to populate the proper renders on each *page*. You can access the data using:
`json-server --watch db.json`
